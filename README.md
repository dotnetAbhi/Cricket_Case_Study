🏏 Cricket Tournament Case Study – Team Grouping & Ranking Logic
📌 Project Overview 
This project is a logic-based case study that simulates a cricket tournament ranking system
It demonstrates how teams can be grouped, filtered, and ranked based on their scores to determine the final winner
The case study focuses on problem-solving, logical thinking, and data handling, commonly used in real-world applications such as tournament systems, leaderboards, and ranking engines.

🎯 Problem Statement
Given 8 cricket teams with their respective scores:,
Divide the teams into two groups based on their scores,
Select the top 2 teams from each group,
Store the selected teams into a new group (Group C),
From Group C, select the top 2 teams,
Finally, determine the Top 1 team (Winner) based on the highest score

🔄 Workflow / Logic Flow
Input 8 teams with scores,
Split teams into Group A and Group B,
Sort teams based on scores,
Select Top 2 teams from each group,
Merge selected teams into Group C,
Sort Group C and determine:,

Final 2 teams.
